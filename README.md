go to https://takeout.google.com/
and make sure that youtube (bottom) is selected and within data ensure subscriptions is selected 
download as zip file (should be small file)

run YT_sublist_scraper.py
select your subscription file and allow it to run (may take a long time)

if it errors before completing fully
take the completed rows and rerun the unfinished rows (need a new file containing only the header and the unprocessed rows)

then can run either the yapms/mapchart files included here or the programs on my html page at https://adam-oregan.github.io

then use the outputs of those on https://yapms.com/app/glb/countries/2020078/blank & https://www.mapchart.net respectively
